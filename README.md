# Explorer Transport Data Science Project
This was a project I did as a part of a 3-week acceletor data analysis and research program hosted by [Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub](https://nebigdatahub.org/about) & [National Student Data Corps](https://nebigdatahub.org/nsdc), in collaboration with the [U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration](https://highways.dot.gov/). Module 5 is where my work begins. I constructed EDA for and developed a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a crash would result in injuries and deaths and poisson process model to predict the number of crashes in each of New York City's boroughs. The poisson process model was relatively effective, the logistic regression model was quite pitiful. Despite the lack of success of the logistic regression model, I got a lot of good practice working with messy, complex and incomplete real world data. Whether it's doing analysis to uncover impactful features designing a robust feature engineering pipeline or building an effective model, I learned a lot about how to experiment with complex real world data to make progress, extract insights and develop models.
